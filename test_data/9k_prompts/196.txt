 ASSISTANT: Space tourism is still a relatively new industry, so there are definitely some safety concerns that need to be addressed. For example, there's always a risk of spacecraft malfunctions or accidents during launch or re-entry. However, companies are taking steps to mitigate these risks and ensure the safety of their passengers. For example, Virgin Galactic requires all of its passengers to undergo extensive training before their flight, and the company's spacecraft is designed with safety features like a feather re-entry system that helps stabilize the craft during descent. 
 USER: Do you think space tourism will have a positive impact on scientific research and space exploration? 
 ASSISTANT: It's possible. While space tourism is primarily focused on providing a unique travel experience for passengers, it could also help fund further space exploration and scientific research. For example, some companies have talked about using profits from space tourism to fund research into space-based solar power or other space-related technologies. 
 USER: That's really interesting. I'm excited to see what the future holds for space tourism. 
 ASSISTANT: Yes, it's definitely an exciting time for space exploration and tourism. Thanks for the interesting conversation! 
 USER: Great, this is the end of our discussion on the topic of the future of space tourism. Let's talk about the next topic. Now the record ends. What is the first topic(s) we discussed? Only give me the topic name. Do not summarize yourself. ASSISTANT:
