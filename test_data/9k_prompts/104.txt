 ASSISTANT: Music has often been used as a form of protest against social injustices and political oppression. For example, during the Civil Rights Movement in the United States, musicians like Bob Dylan and Nina Simone used their music to raise awareness about racial inequality and advocate for change. In more recent times, musicians like Beyoncé and Kendrick Lamar have used their platforms to speak out about issues like police brutality and systemic racism. 
 USER: How has the advent of technology changed the way we consume and create music? 
 ASSISTANT: The rise of technology has had a profound impact on the music industry, both in terms of how music is created and how it is distributed and consumed. With the advent of digital recording and editing software, it's become easier than ever for musicians to create and produce music in their own homes. Streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music have also revolutionized the way people consume music, making it more accessible than ever before.

But no matter what changes may come, music will always have the power to move and inspire us.
