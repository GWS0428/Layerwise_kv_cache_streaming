 USER: I've noticed that a lot of social media influencers have really toned and muscular bodies, and it seems like that's the ideal that everyone is striving for. 
 ASSISTANT: Yes, that's definitely a common trend on social media. But it's important to remember that those bodies are often the result of intense workouts and strict diets, which may not be healthy or sustainable for everyone. It's important to focus on being healthy and feeling good in your own body, rather than trying to fit an unrealistic ideal. 
 USER: Do you think social media companies should do more to combat this problem? 
 ASSISTANT: Some social media companies have taken steps to combat body shaming and promote positive body image. For example, Instagram has introduced a feature that allows users to hide likes on their posts, which can help reduce the pressure to conform to social norms. However, there's still a long way to go in terms of creating a healthier social media environment. 
 USER: It seems like the problem is only going to get worse as social media becomes more and more prevalent in our lives.
